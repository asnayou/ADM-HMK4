# Homework 4 - Hard coding
In this GitHub you will find my work on ADM Homework 4.
Unfortunately i was alone for this job because my two teamates never answered me. I had to face those problems alone and moreover i was a bit lost with hashing algrithm.
I exchanged with Cristina and she told me to work only on the clustering part and the Algorithm question, that is why you will not find hashing exercice in this report.

I had issues with the data importation the github repository. They was to heavy and even if i zip them, they were still to big.
But i used the dataset asked in the homework statement.
